# Custom.tmTheme

A helper for easier creation of Sublime Text & Textmate syntax themes. I'm focusing on HTML, CSS, SCSS, Ruby, PHP, Javascript, Markdown.

*It's just a start. The generated theme is still inconsistent at the moment. Let me know if you're aware of any documentation on available theming options.*

## Usage

Edit the settings in build.rb or the XML files in /parts and build your theme file:

	ruby build.rb
