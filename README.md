# A syntax theme framework for Sublime Text & Textmate

*It's just a start. The generated theme is still inconsistent at the moment. Let me know if you're aware of any documentation on available theming options.*

The goal is a framework for easier .tmTheme creation.
I'm focusing on HTML, CSS, SCSS, Ruby, PHP, Javascript, Markdown.

## Usage

Edit the settings in build.rb or the XML files in /parts and build your theme file:

	ruby build.rb
