# A syntax theme framework for Sublime Text 3 & Textmate

**Attention: It's just a start the theme does not work at the moment. Don't try.**

I'll focus on HTML, CSS, SCSS, Ruby, PHP, Javascript, Markdown. 
Let me know if you're aware of any documentation on available theming options.

## Usage

Build theme file:

	ruby build.rb
